# SARA – Web Application for Measuring Rural Infrastructure Project Impact

This repository contains the source code and technical documentation of **SARA**, a web-based application designed to support the management and impact measurement 
of rural infrastructure projects carried out by Community Action Boards (Juntas de Acción Comunal, JAC).

The system is based on a **service-oriented architecture (SOA)** and integrates data related to activities, resources, participants, timelines, budgets, and intervened infrastructure elements in rural territories.

For additional information about the SARA 1.0 version, interested readers are encouraged to contact the developer via email: **uegomezp@uis.edu.co**

SARA aims to:

- Generate intervention and impact indicators related to rural infrastructure.
- Facilitate data consolidation at different territorial levels 
- Provide transparent and structured information for decision-making  by territorial entities and community organizations.
