# Requirements

SARA requires a MySQL database, a local server environment such as XAMPP, and the source code available in this GitHub repository.

The system is designed to run on Windows and requires PHP and Apache (included in XAMPP) to be properly configured.

Once the environment is set up, the project can be deployed by importing the database and configuring the application according to the provided source code.
