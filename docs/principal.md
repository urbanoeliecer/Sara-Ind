# SARA II - Menu - Measuring the Impact of Rural Infrastructure Projects

Based on the results achieved with SARA I and the increased adoption of the system by JACs, there is a need to incorporate new functionalities aimed at users from territorial entities. Access to information depends on the user’s administrative hierarchy, whether municipal, departmental, or national. This hierarchy determines whether the user can view municipal-level data, departmental data, or information from all departments, according to the filters loaded at login, as shown in Figure 2.
Accordingly, the following information consolidation criteria are defined:
1. When consolidating data by rural areas (veredas), the corresponding municipality and department are identified.
2. When consolidating by department, the total number of municipalities and the total number of rural areas are obtained.
3. When consolidating by municipality, the corresponding department is identified and the total number of Community Action Boards is calculated and displayed in a dedicated column.
