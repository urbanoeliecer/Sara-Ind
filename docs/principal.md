SARA 2.0 is a web-based application developed as a result of Project 4271, VIE–UIS. 
The system is available at https://sara-indicadores.readthedocs.io/, and 
its source code repository is hosted at https://github.com/urbanoeliecer/Sara00.

The application generates reports and intervention indicators related to 
rural infrastructure based on the information managed within SARA, a cloud-based 
architecture designed to support the management of rural community projects.

SARA has been described is a cloud architecture composed of an information system
that facilitates the management of community-based rural projects carried out by 
Community Action Boards (Juntas de Acción Comunal, JAC), with the support of territorial entities. 

In this context, SARA 2.0 extends the capabilities of the original system by providing a 
specialized module for indicator analysis and visualization, using data recorded in SARA 1.0.
Rural communities are commonly managed by groups organized as Community Action Boards, 
which face specific challenges related to access to basic services. In addition, 
they often experience limitations in information availability and management, 
making it difficult to monitor and manage community projects effectively [2]. 

In the Colombian context, JACs are primarily composed of families engaged in agricultural, 
livestock, and other rural-related activities, and they are located in areas with 
a population density of fewer than 150 inhabitants per square kilometer [3].
To address these challenges, SARA was developed as a platform to support the 
management of community projects. In order to strengthen indicator generation in particular, 

SARA 2.0 is proposed as a new system module that enables the calculation and analysis of 
indicators related to projects, participants, resources, intervened elements, and 
participation comparisons, both at the municipal and departmental levels.
